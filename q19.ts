// Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

let countries: string[]= ["Brazil", "Japan", "India", "Ukaraine", "Russia", "Nepal", "Bhutan", "Malaysia", "Srilanka"];

// console.log("List of Countries",countries);


console.log("List of Countries:");
