// Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three to four people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

let guestlist : string[] = ["fahad","ali","bilal","anam"];
guestlist.map((item)=> console.log(`Hi, ${item} you are invited on dinner`));
