// Hello Admin: Make a array of five or more usernames, including the name 'admin'. Imagine you are writing code that will print a greeting to each user after they log in to a website. Loop through the array, and print a greeting to each user:
// • If the username is 'admin', print a special greeting, such as Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?

// • Otherwise, print a generic greeting, such as Hello Eric, thank you for logging in again.

let userName: string[] = ["Eric", "Henry", "Admin","Bob"];
// if (userName.indexOf("Eirc")) {console.log("thank Eric you for logging in again")};
// if (userName.indexOf("Bob")) {console.log("thank Bob you for logging in again")};


userName.forEach(user=> {
    if (user === "Admin") {console.log("Hello Admin, would you like to see a status report?");}  else {console.log(`Hello ${user} thank you for logging in again.`);}
});
