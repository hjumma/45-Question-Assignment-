// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let friendnames : string [] = ["alex", "michal", "robert", "james"];
let message: string= ",would you like visit market today"
