// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

// Array of magician's names
let magicians: string[] = ["Harry Houdini", "David Copperfield", "Penn Jillette", "Teller"];

function show_magicians(magicians: string[]) {
    magicians.forEach(magician => console.log(magician));
}

function make_great(magicians: string[]) {
    for (let i = 0; i < magicians.length; i++) {
        magicians[i] = "the Great " + magicians[i];
    }
}


// Call the function to modify the magicians
make_great(magicians);

// Call the function to show modified magicians
show_magicians(magicians);
